/*

Nodemon is like daemon, its a service that keep running and everytime we change a file, it stops the execution
wait some time, and after we save the file, it's continues the execution

to install nodemon we need; npm install nodemon -g


"-g" install globally

after installed, to use nodemon when "compiling" our file, we have to use "nodemon FILE", instead of "node FILE"
