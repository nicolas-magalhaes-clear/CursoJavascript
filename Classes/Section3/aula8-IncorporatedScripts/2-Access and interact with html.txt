You can access and interact with html using Javascript

We already know that using querySelector method you can select an element
we also can interact with him, define it's html content, his value, or event the classes that he Contains


example:
//Interacting with a input value

<input type="text">

<script>
let inputElement = document.querySelector('input');
inputElement.value = "10";

//if we want to see the changed value
console.log(inputElement.value)

</script>
