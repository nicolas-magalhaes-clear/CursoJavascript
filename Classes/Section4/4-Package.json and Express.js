/*
What is NPM? is a packet manager responsible for install and uninstall packages in our project
We can use it to control which librabies, packages and other stuff we are going to put in our code

The file package.json is the principal file in nodeJS projetcs, it contains the scripts, the dependencies of our code
the version of our project, it's literally the front door of our project or the glossarium

First to start a npm project we have to put in our CMD/Console the following command
"npm init"

After, this we will follow a 'wizard form' filling the informations that is asked to us, like:
-project name (everything in lowercase without blank spaces)
-version
-description
entry point  (what archive will start the project)
-testCommand (which command will be used to test the code)
-gitrepository (auto configure git)
